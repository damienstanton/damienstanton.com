Hello, I:

- am a full-stack software engineer, working [remotely] from the Washington, D.C. metro area. I
specialize in embedded/mobile SDKs, distributed systems, and data science tools/infrastructure.

- have an interest in programming languages and gravitate towards tools like Rust and Swift
that are a pragmatic blend of strong theory and useful expressiveness.

- make music in my spare time, and would like to write more (and write more prose, hence this site)
